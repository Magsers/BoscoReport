# BoscoReport
This repository contains the report for my final year project [Bosco](https://bosco.surge.sh). The report was written in LateX. The report can be found here. [Bosco Report](https://github.com/Magsers/BoscoReport/blob/main/Bosco.pdf)

## Prerequisites
* [LateX](https://www.latex-project.org/get/)
* [Python 2.7 and packages (simplejson, requests, re)](https://www.python.org/download/releases/2.7/)
* [Make](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/make.1.html)

## Generating the Report
# latex
```
sudo apt install texlive-xetex texlive-bibtex-extra biber
```
# python 2
```
sudo apt install virtualenv python2-pip-whl python2-setuptools-whl
virtualenv --python=$(which python2) ../venvs/bosco
source ../venvs/bosco/bin/activate
pip install simplejson requests
```

The report can be generated by running the Makefile in the root directory. 
The command to run the Makefile is
``` 
$ make
```

If errors are encountered generating the report multiple times the following command 
will remove any temporary files and clean the project build.
```
$ make clean
```
